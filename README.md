# catch-the-egg-game

Hello Developers, it's nice to meet you! Welcome to the ReadMe page of the repo. Below is a brief description of the project. 

Name of Project: 
Catch the Egg

Description: 
Catch the Egg game is inspired by a soviet retro game of the 90's that I used to play as a kid. 
The goal is to catch as many falling eggs as possible.

Rules: 
Catch the Egg is a one player game against the computer. The goal is to catch a certain amount of falling eggs 
into the basket before time runs out. If a player misses an egg, one point is deducted from the total score. 
If a player catches an egg, one point is added to the total score. When the player catches the predetermined amount of eggs 
in the time slot allowed, the player moves on to the next level. The next level works just like the first level, but speed 
of falling eggs is increased.

Technology: 

• HTML/CSS to build the visual design of the game
• Flexbox for positioning the login form on the landing page of the game
• jQuery for animating game objects, game controls and storing game score for the player
